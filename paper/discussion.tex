\section{Discussion}
We have developed automated variational inference for Gaussian process models (AGP). 
AGP performs as well as the  exact or hard-coded implementations when testing on five models using six real world datasets.
%
AGP has the potential to be a powerful tool for  GP practitioners and researchers 
when devising models for new or existing problems for which variational inference 
is not yet available.
%The process of investigating a new GP model typically involves tasks 
%such as proposing a new functional form for the likelihood; 
%restraining the domain of the latent function via a transformation; 
%or combining the latent functions to create novel correlations.
%With AGP, these tasks can all be carried out with little effort -- simply by implementing a new likelihood function.
In the future we will address the scalability of 
AGP to deal  with very large datasets.
